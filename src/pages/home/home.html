  <h2>Welcome to DsApp</h2>
  <p>
    This is a project to show the connection between a mobile APP and a BackEnd
    made in python that connects with Machine Learning Models.
  </p>
  <p>
    The BackEnd is done using Flask and the ML models using SkLearn and
    TensorFlow. Watch my
    <a href="https://github.com/isajar" target="_blank"> GitHub </a> to see all
    the portfolio.
    <br />
    Inside my GitHub <code>/PortfolioDS/model-with-endpoint/</code> you could
    check visualization and model creation.
  </p>
  <p>The BackEnd is located in <code>src/Server</code></p>
